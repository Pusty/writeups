# Avr-rev

    Description:
    My Arduino now has internet access! :D
    
Avr-rev consists out of a Intel HEX format AVR Binary and a service to connect to.
The AVR program tries to parse the user input and gives out a number as response.


## Solution

Playing around with the online service reveals some interesting properties.

The parser supports numbers, strings, arrays and dictionaries in a limited fashion.
Matching it up with the parser code in the binary shows that there isn't much more either.

When entering a dictionary the output not only doesn't fail to parse but also outputs a '1' instead of '0'.

```
> {"test":1}
{"test": 1}
1
```

Further playing around shows that entering a number as the dictionary key makes it output a '2'.

```
> {1:2}
{1: 2}
2
```

Diving into the code confirms this behaviour and shows that the next step is to set the key value to 1337 (which is the base10 version of 0x539).

```
> {1337: 1}
{1337: 1}
3
```

Setting the value to a string results in variating output depending on the characters entered:

```
> {1337: "A"}
{1337: "A"}
251
```

A look into the code shows that it takes each character from the string entered and subtracts them from a value read from an internal register.
If the values match it continues with then next character, otherwise it outputs the difference and exits.

Using a small helper function and just entering A's as a start reveals the secret string by slowly matching it.

```python
def delta(v):
    if v > 0x7f:
        return chr(ord("A")+(0xff-v+1))
    return chr(ord("A")-v)
```

```
> {1337: "First: midnight{only31?} But AAA"}
{1337: "First: midnight{only31?} But AAA"}
205

> {1337: "First: midnight{only31?} But tAA"}
{1337: "First: midnight{only31?} But tAA"}
210

> {1337: "First: midnight{only31?} But toA"}
{1337: "First: midnight{only31?} But toA"}
33

> {1337: "First: midnight{only31?} But to "}
{1337: "First: midnight{only31?} But to "}

# Pybonhash

    Description:
    What's this newfangled secure hashing technique?
    
Pybonhash consists out of pybonhash.cpython-36.pyc and hash.txt.
When giving pybonhash an input file it "hashes" the content with the flag as key.

## Solution

Decompiling the `pybonhash.cpython-36.pyc` file with uncompyle6 shows a relatively simple "hashing" algorithm.

```python
import string, sys, hashlib, binascii
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
from flag import key
if not len(key) == 42:
    raise AssertionError
data = open(sys.argv[1], 'rb').read()
if not len(data) >= 191:
    raise AssertionError
FIBOFFSET = 4919
MAXFIBSIZE = len(key) + len(data) + FIBOFFSET

def fibseq(n):
    out = [
     0, 1]
    for i in range(2, n):
        out += [out[i - 1] + out[i - 2]]
    return out

FIB = fibseq(MAXFIBSIZE)
i = 0
output = ''
while i < len(data):
    data1 = data[FIB[i] % len(data)]
    key1 = key[(i + FIB[FIBOFFSET + i]) % len(key)]
    i += 1
    data2 = data[FIB[i] % len(data)]
    key2 = key[(i + FIB[FIBOFFSET + i]) % len(key)]
    i += 1
    tohash = bytes([data1, data2])
    toencrypt = hashlib.md5(tohash).hexdigest()
    thiskey = bytes([key1, key2]) * 16
    cipher = AES.new(thiskey, AES.MODE_ECB)
    enc = cipher.encrypt(toencrypt)
    output += binascii.hexlify(enc).decode('ascii')

print(output)
```



Because characters are MD5 hashed in pairs of two and AES encrypted with only two characters of the key each iteration it's possible to reconstruct the key and parts of the input data based on the hash.

By first creating a lookup table for all hashed data combinations:

```python
# Build Lookup table for the hashed data pairs
def buildTable():
    table = {}
    for data1 in range(0x100):
        for data2 in range(0x100):
            table[hashlib.md5(chr(data1)+chr(data2)).hexdigest()] = chr(data1)+chr(data2)
    return table
```

And then for each block trying each possible key until a matching entry is found:

```python
# Try all key combinations until a matching table entry was found
def tryKeys(table, data):
    for key1 in range(0x100):
        for key2 in range(0x100):
            thiskey = (chr(key1)+chr(key2)) * 16
            cipher = AES.new(thiskey, AES.MODE_ECB)
            enc = cipher.decrypt(data.decode("hex"))
            if enc in table:
                return ((chr(key1)+chr(key2)), table[enc])
    return None
```

Each block can be individually decrypted, each time leaking parts of the key and data:

```python
def decrypt(s):
    dataTable = buildTable() # create lookup table
    FIB = fibseq(MAXFIBSIZE) # create fib sequence like in the encoder
    i = 0
    keyR = list(" "*key_len)   # output key character list
    dataR = list(" "*data_len) # output data character list
    for j in range(len(s)/64):
        d1_i = FIB[i] % data_len # encoding index for the first data byte
        k1_i = (i + FIB[FIBOFFSET + i]) % key_len # encoding index for the first key byte
        i = i + 1
        d2_i = FIB[i] % data_len # encoding index for the second data byte
        k2_i = (i + FIB[FIBOFFSET + i]) % key_len # encoding index for the second key byte
        i = i + 1
        part = s[j*64:(j+1)*64] # extract the relevant 32 byte block from the hex encoded hash
        res = (tryKeys(dataTable, part)) # try all keys until a match is found, returns (key, data) pair
        keyR[k1_i] = res[0][0]           # save all entries
        keyR[k2_i] = res[0][1]
        dataR[d1_i] = res[1][0]
        dataR[d2_i] = res[1][1]
        print(''.join(keyR))             # print progress
    return (''.join(keyR) , ''.join(dataR)) # return resulting key and data
   
```

Which in the end recovers the full "hashing key":
